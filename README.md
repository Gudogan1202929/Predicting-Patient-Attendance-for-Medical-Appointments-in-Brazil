# Predicting-Patient-Attendance-for-Medical-Appointments-in-Brazil

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset of 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil to determine the factors that influence whether patients show up for their scheduled appointments. The dataset includes various patient characteristics and the appointment details. By understanding these factors, we can develop predictive models to improve appointment scheduling and reduce no-show rates.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key columns:

ScheduledDay: The date the patient scheduled the appointment.
Neighborhood: The location of the hospital.
Scholarship: Indicates whether the patient is enrolled in the Brazilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia.
No-show: Indicates whether the patient showed up for their appointment ('No' means they showed up, 'Yes' means they did not show up).
Objectives
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Examine the dataset for missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers. Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
Feature Analysis: Identify and analyze the key features that may influence patient attendance.
Predictive Modeling: Develop and evaluate predictive models to forecast whether a patient will show up for their appointment.
Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
Steps
Data Loading and Initial Exploration

Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handle missing values and correct any data inconsistencies.
Encode categorical variables and transform date-related columns as needed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the distribution of key features.
Analyze correlations between features and the target variable (No-show).
Identify significant patterns and trends.
Feature Engineering

Create new features if necessary (e.g., day of the week of the appointment, time difference between scheduling and appointment).
Model Building and Evaluation

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Develop and evaluate various classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting).
Assess model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Insights and Recommendations

Summarize key findings from the analysis.
Provide recommendations to reduce no-show rates based on the analysis.
Documentation and Reporting

Document the entire process, including code, visualizations, and findings.
Prepare a comprehensive report with insights and recommendations.
